                <h1>Cataract</h1>

        <h2>About Cataract</h2>
        <p>A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. It can be compared to a window that is frosted or yellowed. The amount and pattern of cloudiness within the lens can vary. It can be an immature cataract or a mature cataract depending on the degree of opacification of the lens.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Common symptoms of cataract include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuzzy or blurry vision</li>
            <li>Glare or light sensitivity</li>
            <li>Poor night vision</li>
            <li>Poor day vision (for central cataracts)</li>
            <li>Double vision in one eye</li>
            <li>Needing brighter light to read</li>
            <li>Fading or yellowing of colors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>The most common type of cataract is related to aging of the eye. Other causes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Family history</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Injury to the eye</li>
            <li>Medications, especially steroids</li>
            <li>Long-term, unprotected exposure to sunlight</li>
            <li>Previous eye surgery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most age-related cataracts progress gradually over a period of years. In a normal eye, light focuses precisely on the retina. In an eye with a cataract, light scatters throughout the eye instead of focusing precisely on the retina. Other cataracts, especially in younger people and people with diabetes, may progress rapidly over a short time.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>By performing a thorough eye examination, your ophthalmologist can detect the presence of a cataract. A careful evaluation will also rule out any other conditions that may be causing blurred vision or other eye problems. If improvement in your vision is unlikely, cataract removal may not be recommended. Your ophthalmologist can tell you how much visual improvement is likely.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Surgery is the only way a cataract can be removed. However, if symptoms of a cataract are not bothering you very much, surgery may not be needed. Sometimes a simple change in your eyeglass prescription may be helpful in the early stages. There are no medications, dietary supplements, or exercises that have been shown to prevent or cure cataracts.</p>
        
        <h3>When should surgery be done?</h3>
        <p>Surgery should be considered when cataracts cause enough loss of vision to interfere with your daily activities. It is not true that cataracts need to be “ripe” before they can be removed. In fact, the harder a cataract gets, the more difficult it is to remove with modern techniques like phacoemulsification.</p>

        <h3>What can I expect from cataract surgery?</h3>
        <p>Cataract surgery is a highly successful procedure, with over 95% of surgeries performed with no complications. The cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a permanent intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The surgery is performed using ultrasound energy (phacoemulsification) through a tiny, sutureless incision, allowing for a safe, fast, and effective outcome. After surgery, you will use eyedrops to help the eye heal.</p>

        <h2>Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)</h2>
        <p>Recent advances in IOL design using wavefront technology have led to a new category of aspheric IOLs, which are capable of providing an excellent quality of vision and improved contrast sensitivity. This can lead to improved night vision and decreased glare.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spherical IOLs:</strong> These are standard lenses, but their optical performance can be compromised on the periphery, affecting vision in low light.</li>
            <li><strong>Aspheric IOLs:</strong> These advanced lenses provide sharp and clear images even in low light conditions and are the preferred choice for restoring normal distance vision.</li>
        </ul>
