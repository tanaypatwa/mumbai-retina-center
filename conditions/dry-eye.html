                <h1>Dry Eyes & Computer Vision Syndrome</h1>

        <h2>What is Dry Eye?</h2>
        <p>Normally, the eye constantly bathes itself in tears to stay moist and comfortable. When the eye does not produce enough tears, or produces tears of poor quality, the condition is known as dry eye. It is a common and often chronic problem, particularly in older adults.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms of Dry Eye</h2>
        <p>The usual symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stinging, burning, or scratchy sensations</li>
            <li>Stringy mucus in or around the eyes</li>
            <li>Increased irritation from smoke or wind</li>
            <li>Excessive tearing (a reflex to the irritation)</li>
            <li>Discomfort when wearing contact lenses</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of Dry Eye</h2>
        <p>Tear production normally decreases with age. Dry eye is more common in women, especially after menopause. It can also be associated with other health problems like Sjogren's syndrome, arthritis, and thyroid disease. Many common medications can also reduce tear secretion. Environmental factors like a dry climate or prolonged screen time can also contribute.</p>

        <h2>Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)</h2>
        <p>A major contributor to dry eye today is Computer Vision Syndrome, also known as digital eye strain. It is caused by prolonged use of computers, tablets, and smartphones. When we focus on a screen, our blink rate can decrease by up to 50%, leading to tears evaporating more quickly and causing dry, tired eyes.</p>
        <h3>Tips to Reduce CVS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Follow the 20-20-20 rule:</strong> Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to view something 20 feet away.</li>
            <li><strong>Blink frequently:</strong> Make a conscious effort to blink more often to remoisten your eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust your workstation:</strong> Position your screen slightly below eye level and reduce glare from windows or lights.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
        <p>An ophthalmologist can diagnose dry eye after a thorough examination, which may include measuring the quantity and quality of your tears. Treatment aims to restore or maintain the normal amount of tears in the eye to minimize dryness and discomfort.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Artificial Tears:</strong> The most common treatment is the use of lubricating eye drops. Preservative-free drops are recommended for frequent use.</li>
            <li><strong>Punctal Plugs:</strong> Tiny plugs can be inserted into the tear ducts (puncta) to block tear drainage, keeping the eyes moist.</li>
            <li><strong>Prescription Medications:</strong> Your doctor may prescribe medications like Restasis® or Xiidra® to increase tear production.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Using a humidifier, wearing wraparound sunglasses outdoors, and taking nutritional supplements with omega-3 fatty acids can also help.</li>
        </ul>
