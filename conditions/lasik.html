        <h1>LASIK (Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis)</h1>

        <h2>About LASIK</h2>
        <p>LASIK is a refractive surgery procedure intended to correct vision and reduce a person's dependency on glasses or contact lenses. It is a preferred alternative to PRK (Photo-Refractive Keratectomy) because it requires less time for full recovery and the patient experiences no pain.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Choose LASIK?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is the preferred choice for refractive surgery by eye surgeons worldwide.</li>
            <li>The procedure is done on an outpatient basis.</li>
            <li>Both eyes can often be treated on the same day.</li>
            <li>Experience clarity of vision within hours of surgery.</li>
            <li>No more daily rituals with visual aids.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lifestyle Benefits</h2>

        <h2>Wavefront Guided Custom LASIK</h2>
        <p>Customized LASIK offers a higher potential for perfect vision and a lower potential for visual compromise. It is ideal for patients with complex prescriptions or those who seek the best possible visual outcome.</p>
        <p>Using Wavefront technology, we analyze your eye's unique characteristics to create a personalized treatment plan. This approach removes any distortion from the optical path to bring objects into perfect focus, offering a greater opportunity for 20/20 vision and reducing issues like night glare.</p>

        <h2>The Treatment Process</h2>
        <p>Our professional consultants will examine your eyes using state-of-the-art equipment. To ensure accurate measurements, you will be advised to stop wearing soft contact lenses for one week and rigid lenses for two weeks before the examination.</p>
        
        <h2>After the Procedure</h2>
        <p>You will receive personalized aftercare instructions and eye drops. It is normal to experience some watering of the eyes, but it's important not to rub them. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor your healing and the success of the treatment.</p>
