        <h1>Macular Degeneration (AMD)</h1>

        <h2>What is Macular Degeneration?</h2>
        <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a deterioration of the macula, the small central area of the retina that allows you to see fine details clearly. When the macula does not function correctly, your central vision can be affected by blurriness, dark areas, or distortion. It affects your ability to read, drive, and recognize faces. While AMD reduces central vision, it does not affect peripheral (side) vision and does not result in total blindness.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of AMD</h2>
        
        <h3>"Dry" (Atrophic) Macular Degeneration</h3>
        <p>Most people have the "dry" form of AMD, which is caused by the aging and thinning of the tissues of the macula. Vision loss is usually gradual. Deposits under the retina called drusen are a common feature. While drusen alone may not cause vision loss, an increase in their size or number can indicate an increased risk of developing advanced AMD.</p>

        <h3>"Wet" (Exudative) Macular Degeneration</h3>
        <p>The "wet" form accounts for about 10% of cases and results from abnormal blood vessels forming underneath the retina. These vessels leak fluid or blood, blurring and distorting central vision. Vision loss can be rapid and severe.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms of Macular Degeneration</h2>
        <p>The condition may be hardly noticeable in its early stages. Common symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Words on a page look blurred.</li>
            <li>A dark or empty area appears in the center of vision.</li>
            <li>Straight lines look distorted (metamorphopsia).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>An ophthalmologist can detect AMD during a comprehensive eye examination. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Amsler grid test to check for distortions in your central vision.</li>
            <li>Viewing the macula with an ophthalmoscope.</li>
            <li>Fluorescein angiography, a special photographic dye test to find abnormal blood vessels.</li>
            <li>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to get a detailed cross-sectional image of the retina.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>While there is no cure for AMD, some treatments can slow its progression and, in some cases, improve vision.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AREDS2 Vitamin Formulations:</strong> A specific high-dose formulation of vitamins and minerals can help slow the progression of dry AMD in some people.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-VEGF Injections:</strong> The standard treatment for wet AMD involves injecting medications (like Avastin速, Lucentis速, Eylea速) into the eye to stop the growth of abnormal blood vessels and reduce leakage.</li>
            <li><strong>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT):</strong> A light-activated drug (Visudyne速) is used to close leaking blood vessels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and management of AMD.</p>
