        <h1>Retinal Detachment</h1>

        <h2>What is a Retinal Detachment?</h2>
        <p>A retinal detachment is a serious eye emergency causing acute, painless vision loss. The retina, the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye, pulls away from its normal position. If not treated early, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent vision loss. It is more likely to develop in people who are nearsighted, have a family history of retinal detachments, or have sustained a serious eye injury.</p>
        
        <h2>Causes and Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Most retinal detachments are caused by one or more small tears or holes in the retina. As the vitreous (the gel-like substance in the eye) shrinks with age, it can pull on the retina and cause a tear. Fluid can then pass through the tear and lift the retina off the back of the eye.</p>
        <h3>Warning Signs:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A sudden increase in floaters (small dark spots or squiggly lines)</li>
            <li>Flashes of light in one or both eyes</li>
            <li>A wavy or watery quality in your vision</li>
            <li>The appearance of a dark shadow or a "curtain" over a portion of your visual field</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it is crucial to see an ophthalmologist immediately. Early treatment for a retinal tear can prevent a full detachment.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>An ophthalmologist can diagnose a retinal detachment or tear during a comprehensive eye exam where the pupils are dilated. This allows for a clear view of the retina at the back of the eye using an indirect ophthalmoscope.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>If the retina is torn but not yet detached, the tear can often be sealed with a laser (photocoagulation) or a freezing treatment (cryopexy) to prevent a detachment. Once the retina has detached, surgery is required to repair it.</p>
        <h3>Surgical Options:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pneumatic Retinopexy:</strong> A gas bubble is injected into the eye to push the retina back into place.</li>
            <li><strong>Scleral Buckle:</strong> A silicone band is placed around the eye to gently push the eye wall against the retina, allowing the tear to heal.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitrectomy:</strong> The vitreous gel is removed and replaced, often with a gas bubble or silicone oil, to hold the retina in place.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With modern surgical techniques, over 90% of retinal detachments can be successfully reattached, though sometimes more than one operation is necessary. The degree of vision that returns depends on how long the retina was detached.</p>
