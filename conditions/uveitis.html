        <h1>Uveitis</h1>

        <h2>What is Uveitis?</h2>
        <p>Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of your eye. The eye is shaped much like a ball, with three different layers of tissue. The uvea is the middle layer, between the sclera (the white wall of the eye) and the retina (the light-sensing inner layer).</p>
        <p>The uvea contains many blood vessels that nourish important parts of the eye, such as the retina. Inflammation of the uvea can damage your sight and can be potentially blinding if left untreated. A "red eye" that does not clear up quickly should be examined by an ophthalmologist, as it may be a sign of uveitis.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms of Uveitis</h2>
        <p>Symptoms of uveitis can come on suddenly and may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Light sensitivity (photophobia)</li>
            <li>Blurring of vision</li>
            <li>Pain</li>
            <li>Redness of the eye</li>
            <li>Floaters</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of Uveitis</h2>
        <p>Uveitis can have many different causes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Viruses (such as shingles, mumps, or herpes)</li>
            <li>Fungi (such as histoplasmosis)</li>
            <li>Parasites (such as toxoplasmosis)</li>
            <li>Systemic diseases (such as arthritis or sarcoidosis)</li>
            <li>Injury to the eye</li>
            <li>Bacteria (such as syphilis)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, in up to 80% of cases, the specific cause of uveitis remains unknown.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>An ophthalmologist can diagnose uveitis through a thorough eye examination. This may involve examining the inside of your eye with special microscopes. Blood tests, skin tests, and X-rays may be required to determine if the uveitis is related to a disease in another part of the body.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Uveitis is a serious eye condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent complications. Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and prevent further damage to the eye.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steroids:</strong> These are the mainstay of treatment and can be given as eye drops, injections around the eye, or pills.</li>
            <li><strong>Cycloplegic Eye Drops:</strong> These drops dilate the pupil to prevent muscle spasms and reduce pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Immunosuppressive Drugs:</strong> In severe cases or if the uveitis is not responding to steroids, medication to suppress the immune system may be prescribed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If uveitis is caused by an underlying infection or disease, treating that condition is also essential.</p>
