                            <summary>What causes retinal detachment?</summary>
                            <p>Retinal detachment is caused by a combination of factors including retinal holes, breaks, or tears; liquefaction of the vitreous humor; and mechanical forces (traction) on the retina.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary>What is the relationship between near-sightedness and retinal detachment?</summary>
                            <p>While being near-sighted doesn't directly cause detachment, certain peripheral retinal degenerations (like lattice degeneration) are more common in near-sighted individuals and can lead to retinal holes or tears, increasing the risk.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Can retinal detachment cause total blindness?</summary>
                            <p>Yes, if left untreated, a retinal detachment can progress and lead to permanent and total vision loss in the affected eye.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary>What treatments are used for retinal detachment repair?</summary>
                            <p>The primary treatments are surgical and include Vitrectomy, Scleral Buckle, and Pneumatic Retinopexy (gas bubble injection). Laser or cryotherapy is also used to seal the retinal breaks.</p>
                        </details>
                         <details>
                            <summary>Is surgery the only option?</summary>
                            <p>For a retinal detachment, surgery is almost always necessary. Medications or eye drops cannot reattach the retina. In some cases of small holes or tears without detachment, laser treatment may be sufficient to prevent a detachment from occurring.</p>
