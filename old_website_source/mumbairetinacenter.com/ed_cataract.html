						  <p>A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the  eye. It can be compared to a window that is frosted or yellowed. This term is  derived from the cataract of a waterfall ie the white colour of the water  dropping from a height.</p>
					      <p>The amount and pattern of cloudiness within the lens can  vary. It can be a immature cataract or a mature cataract depending on the  degree of opasification of the lens.</p>
					      <p>Common symptoms of cataract include:</p>
					      <ul class="bullet">
                            <li>Fuzzy vision</li>

                           <p>The most common type of cataract is related to aging of the  eye. Causes of cataract include:</p>

                             <li>family history;</li>

                           <p>In an eye with a cataract, light scatters throughout the eye  instead of focusing precisely on the retina.</p>
                           Other  cataracts, especially in younger people and people with diabetes, may progress  rapidly over a short time. &ndash; Osmotic cataract

							<p><span class="heading2">How is a cataract  detected?</span></p>
							<p>By performing a thorough eye examination, your  ophthalmologist (Eye M.D.) can detect the presence of a cataract.</p>
							<p>A  careful evaluation will also rule out any other conditions that may be causing  blurred vision or other eye problems. Problems with other parts of the eye  (such as the cornea, retina or optic nerve) can be responsible for vision loss  and may prevent you from having much or any improvement in vision after  cataract surgery. If improvement in your vision is unlikely, cataract removal  may not be recommended. Your ophthalmologist can tell you how much visual  improvement is likely. </p>

							<p><span class="heading2">How is cataract  treated?</span></p>
							<p>There are no tablet or drops which can prevent or reverse  cataract formation Surgery is the only way a cataract can be removed. However,  if symptoms of cataract are not bothering you very much, surgery may not be  needed. Sometimes a simple change in your eyeglass prescription may be helpful  in the early stages.</p>
							<p>No medications, dietary supplements or exercises have been  shown to prevent or cure cataracts</p>
							<p>Sunglasses that screen out ultraviolet (UV)  light rays or regular eyeglasses with a clear, anti-UV coating offer this  protection. &nbsp; </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">When should surgery be done?</span></p>
							<p>Surgery should be considered when cataracts cause enough  loss of vision to interfere with your daily activities. This may vary from  person to person depending on their individual needs and lifestyle.</p>
							<p>It is not true that cataracts need to be &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; before they  can be removed or that they need to be removed just because they are present.  The more you ripen a cataract the more difficult it is to remove with laser.(  Phacoemulsifacation) as its gets hard.</p>
							<p>Cataract surgery can be performed when your visual needs  require it. </p>
							<p>Based  on your symptoms, you and your ophthalmologist should decide together when  surgery is appropriate. </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">What can I expect  from cataract surgery?</span></p>
							<p>Over 1.4 million people have cataract surgery each year, and  more than 95% of those surgeries are performed with no complications.</p>
							<p>During cataract surgery, which is usually performed under  local anesthesia as an outpatient procedure, the cloudy lens is removed from  the eye. In most cases, the focusing power of the natural lens is restored by  replacing it with a permanent intraocular lens implant.</p>
							<p>Your ophthalmologist performs this delicate surgery using a  microscope, miniature instruments and other modern technology. A machine which  generates ultra sound energy is used to emulsify the cataract and remove it  through a 3 mm incision &ndash; phaco emulsification. Thought his small utureless  incision a foldable intraocular soft lens is injected this latest sate or art  technique provide you a safe fast and effective outcome.</p>
							<p>After surgery, you will have to take eyedrops as your  ophthalmologist directs. Your surgeon will check your eye several times to make  sure it is healing properly.</p>
							<p>Cataract surgery is a highly successful procedure. Improved  vision is the result in over 95% of cases, unless there is a problem with the  cornea, retina, optic nerve or other structures. </p>
							<p>In many people who have cataract surgery, the natural  capsule that supports the intraocular lens becomes cloudy. If this occurs, your  ophthalmologist can perform an outpatient laser procedure to open this cloudy  capsule, restoring clear vision. This is called YAG laser capsuelotormy and is  a light treatment non surgical in nature. </p>
							<p>Cataracts  are a common cause of decreased vision, particularly for the elderly, but they  are treatable. Your ophthalmologist can tell you whether cataract or some other  problem is the cause of your vision loss and can help you decide if cataract  surgery is appropriate for you.</p>
