					      <p>Diabetes is one of the growing diseases in India. In 1995  nearly 135 million people had diabetes throughout the world; however, the World  Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that in India, the number of adults  with diabetes would be the highest for any part of the world: a startling 195  percent increase, from 19 million in 1995 to 54 million in 2025. India is  poised to have the largest number of diabetes in the world by year 2020 hence  we have to gear up to face this challenge where vision loss due to diabetes  would be a major concern.</p>
					      <p>The central part of the retina is  known as macula, and is the most important and sensitive area for us to see and  read. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, if the damaged blood vessels leak  fluid and lipids onto the macula, it results in a condition known as diabetic  maculopathy, an important reason for blurring of vision in diabetics.</p>
					      <p>Diabetes  is the most commonly treated disease &amp; cause of concern as its prevalence  has been rising steadily. People with diabetes are at risk of developing eye  disease that can permanently damage their vision and even lead to blindness.  Diabetes causes diabetic retinopathy as well as other disorders such as retinal  arterial and venous occlusions. Diabetes can also result in early onset  cataract formation, glaucoma and strokes affecting the optic nerve (anterior  ischaemic optic neuropathy - AION). </p>
					      
					      <p><span class="heading2">What is Diabetic Retinopathy?</span></p>
						  <p>Diabetic retinopathy affects people with diabetes. All  patients with diabetes will develop Retinopathy at some stage in their life &ndash;  80 % will develop at 20 years of the disease. The eye is like a camera with the  lens in the front and the film behind celled the Retina on which the image  falls to be transmitted to the brain. The high sugar level in the blood weakens  and affects the functions of the capillaries (small blood vessels) in the  retina (the back of the eye), resulting in diabetic retinopathy. When this  happens, the capillaries cannot function normally and they start to form out  pouchings &ndash; micro aneurysms that can result in small areas of bleeding seen in  early disease classified as <strong>mild non  proliferative diabetic retinopathy</strong>. The abnormal capillaries can also leak  fluid containing proteins and fatty substances into the retina, causing swelling  of the retina, known as <strong>macular oedema.</strong> The weakened capSillaries may collapse and close and&nbsp; cause blood and oxygen supply to the area to fail, leading to  ischaemia (Capillary non perfusion) and cell death of the affected this will in  turn trigger the growth of new capillaries &ndash; NVD NVE to enables more blood and  oxygen to be delivered to the affected retina. This stage of disease is called <strong>proliferative diabetic retinopathy</strong>.  These new capillaries however are abnormal and weak. They can&nbsp; rupture and bleed &ndash; vitreous hemorrhage&nbsp; and cause sudden loss of vision. As they  grow, scar tissue grows with them, which can exert fractional force on the  retina, causing <strong>tractional retinal  detachments</strong> with distortion or loss of vision.</p>

                           <p><span class="heading2">How will I know if I  have diabetic retinopathy?</span></p>
                           <p>Unfortunately, it remain a sympotomatic vision remains  normal in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy and the diabetic individual  can be totally symptom free. As the diabetic retinopathy advances, there may be  a slow but progressive visual loss. Alternatively, there might be sudden visual  loss with floaters because of bleeding inside the eye.</p>
					       <p><span class="heading2">What increases the  risk of developing diabetic retinopathy?</span></p>
					      <p>The most important risk factor is duration of  diabetes. The longer the duration, the greater the likelihood of developing  diabetic retinopathy. The next most important risk factor is blood sugar  control. Several studies done&nbsp; have  shown that good sugar control not only prolongs the onset of diabetic  retinopathy, it also controls the severity of the disease. Other risk factors  include concurrent disease affecting other organs such as kidneys, nervous  system, anaemia, high blood pressure, high cholestserol, eye surgery, cigarette  smoking and pregnancy. All people with diabetes are at  risk; during pregnancy, diabetic retinopathy may worsen.</p>

					        <a name="diagnosed" id="diagnosed"></a>How is it Diagnosed</span></p>
							<p><span class="heading2"><strong>Diabetic Retinopathy- Complications that harm  your eyes</strong></span></p>
							<p>Unfortunately, the complications caused by diabetes do not end  with background and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. If it were so,  ophthalmologist might not see so much havoc wrought by diabetes. A diabetic  patient can prevent most of his complications if he educates himself about the  disease and its deleterious effects on various body parts. A diabetic who knows  the most lives the longest. </p>
							<p>This new vessel growth in PDR is the retina&rsquo;s method of  coping with the closing of its own blood vessels and the loss of nourishment.</p>
							<p>But the problem is that when new blood vessels do develop,  they are never any good; like the natural vessels we have they are, in fact,  dangerous to the eye. They do not nourish the retina properly, and they may  cause other problems.</p>
							<p>One problem is bleeding into the vitreous cavity &ndash; called vitreous  hemorrhage. A second problem is the growth of scar tissue on the retina that  can pull the retina off the back wall of the eye-called a traction retinal  detachment.</p>
							<p>A third problem occurs when the abnormal new blood vessels  grow on the iris, the colored part of the eye, rather than just on the retina.  This condition is called rubeosis iridis. When these blood vessels grow on the  iridis, they may close off the normal flow of fluid out of the eye and cause  the pressure in the eye to rise. The high pressure, called neovascular glaucoma  sometimes causes permanent changes, resulting in visual loss, pain. </p>
							<p>It is very important to understand that the closing of  retinal blood vessels and the growth of new blood vessels may occur without any  noticeable change of vision. When vitreous hemorrhage occurs, there is a sudden  blurring of vision and the appearance of spots that look like strings,  spiderwebs, or insects that seem to float in front of the eye. It is often  helpful for the patient who develops a vitreous hemorrhage to remain in a  sitting position so that gravity can help settle the blood to the lower parts  of the viteous cavity.</p>
							<p>Once the blood settles, panretinal laser photocoagulation  can be done. Laser cannot make the blood disappear, but it can prevent more  bleeding and expedite the clearing of a hammerage. The vitreous hemorrhage that  is present usually disappears with time &ndash; we wait for approximately 1 to 3  months </p>
							<p>If there is so much viteous hemorrhage that laser treatment  is not possible or if the blood does not disappear on its own, it can be  removed with an operation called a Vitrectomy. The blood-filled vitreous gel is  removed. The lack of vitreous gel does not affect the function of the eye.
							  This operationsis done through a key hole &frac12; mm opening in  the&nbsp; white part of the eye.</p>
							<p>When a retinal detachment occurs, the patient will notice a  shadow or very large dark area in the vision. When the retinal detachment  extends to the macula, the dark shadow will be straight ahead and vision will  be very poor. The abnormal new blood vessels and scar tissue also can cause  visual loss because they can wrinkle the retina - Metamorphopsia</p>
							<p>The only way the patient can regain any vision is for the  retina to be reattached and the blood vessels and scar tissue to be removed  from the surface of the retina. This is accomplished by Vitrectomy surgery. The  surgeon removes the vitreous gel from the eye so that it stops pulling on the  retina and the traction can be released. Some times gases or silicon oil are  injected as vitrious substitute for retinal tamponard. The surgeon may remove  the scar tissue from the surface of the retina so that there is no wrinkling of  the retina. </p>
							<p>Laser may be used to prevent late development of abnormal  new vessels and rubeosis. The surgeons also laser inside the eye to seal any  tears of the retina. If there are tears in the retina, the surgeon places a  large air bubble in the eye to press the retina completely against the back  wall of the eye while the laser treatment takes hold. In time, the air bubble  will disappear and be replaced by the eye&rsquo;s own fluid.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;What is important is to remember that once retinopathy  starts, even the control of blood sugar will not stop it. This makes it vital  for people to have an eye examination once a year not just when their sugar is  high but even when it has been controlled.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">What can I do to prevent diabetic retinopathy or  stop its progress?</span></p>
							<p>Most importantly, you should ensure good control of the  blood sugar levels. Ideally, the HbA1c levels should be less than 7.0% and the  average blood glucose level should be less than 80mg/L. This can be achieved  through compliance with treatment, regular visits to the doctors and being  careful with food and a good exercise regimen.</p>
							<p>Can diabetic retinopathy <strong>be cured once it develops?</strong><br />
							  No. In the early stage, with very minimal changes and good  blood sugar control, it is possible to stabilise the diabetic retinopathy. <br />
							  Once there is advanced diabetic retinopathy, the aim of the  treatment will be to preserve what vision is left. Unfortunately, damaged  retinal&nbsp; nerve cells cannot be replaced  as nerve cells cannot reproduce themselves. </p>
							<p>The mainstay of treatment for severe diabetic retinopathy is  laser photocoagulation. This involves creating tiny burns on the retinal  surface to control the disease process. However, if there is very advanced  diabetic retinopathy with scar tissue formation and retinal detachment, surgery  to remove the scar tissue and return the retina back to its original position  will have to be considered.</p>
							<p>They are very effective in reducing vision loss from this disease. In  fact, even people with advanced retinopathy have a 90 per cent chance of  keeping their vision provided they get treatment before the retina is severely  damaged.</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Can  diabetic retinopathy lead to blindness?</span></p>
							<p><strong>YES! Due to  tractional retinal detachment affecting both eyes as diabetes affects both your  eyes due to the poison in your blood.<br />
                              </strong><br />
							  Once there is damage to the nerve cells of the retina, these  cells cannot reproduce themselves and vision will be permanently affected.</p>
							<p>So, <strong>what should a  person with diabetes do in terms of his/her eye care?</strong></p>
							<p>Every  diabetic patient should meet his eye surgeon as often as he meets his  diabetologist . It is important to go for a yearly diabetic retinopathy  screening. This can be achieved with photography of the back of the eye, i.e.  the retina. The photograph will be able to document the presence or absence of  diabetic retinopathy. Fundus flourescien&nbsp;  angiography is the angriophuy of the retina showing us leaking vessels  and helping us to guide our laser treatment accordingly.</p>

						    <a name="treated" id="treated"></a>How is it Treated</span></p>
							<p>There are two treatments for  diabetic retinopathy. </p>
							<p>These two treatments are laser surgery and vitreous surgery, It is  important to remember that though both of these treatments are very successful,  they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Lasers in Diabetic Retinopathy</span> </p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Laser surgery can be helpful for  the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The laser beam is a high-energy light  which is collimated into fine focus that turns to heat when it is focused on  the parts of the retina to be treated.</p>
							<p>The laser treatment does not affect  the outer eye &ndash; the cornea or the lens . The physician uses drops to widen  pupil, then aims the beam through the open pupil directly at the retina. <br />
							  In background diabetic retinopathy (BDR),  the laser heat either seals the leaking blood vessels of the macula or reduces  their leakage and allows the macula to dry. It is like sealing the leak by  welding your water pipe.</p>
							<p>In proliferative diabetic  retinopathy (PDR), the laser destroys the diseased portions of the retina to  stop the growth of new blood vessels by reducing the formation of various  factors which lead to neovasularisation &ndash; VEGF &ndash; vascular endothelial growth  factor.</p>
							<p>Initially a special test called fluorescein angiography may be done. To  do the test, dye is injected into a vein in the patient&rsquo;s arm. The dye travels  throughout the body, including the eyes. With a special camera and a flash,  photographs will show what kinds of changes have occurred in the retina and the  areas which are leaking to help plan the treatment better. </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Lasers in Maculopathy</span> </p>
				<p>There are two types of laser  treatment for non proliferative diabetic retinopathy-local (or specific)  treatment, and grid treatment. With local treatment, the specific leaking spots  in the retina are found by a fluorescein angiogram, which is then used as a  guide for the laser in an attempt to stop the leakage.</p>
							<p>In some cases of non proliferative diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels  appear to be leaking everywhere in the macula and not just in a few specific  areas. In such cases, a scatter of argon laser photocoagulation in a grid  pattern is placed across the entire wet macular area.</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Laser in PDR</span> </p>
							<p>If the amount of new vessels is  great, laser treatment can often prevent loss of vision. The type of laser  treatment that is done when there are a lot of vessels is called pan-retinal  photocoagulation.</p>
							<p>This type of laser treatment is usually done in three or more separate  sessions. The idea is to use the laser to destroy all of the dead areas of  retina where the blood vessels have been closed. When these areas are treated  with the laser, the retina stops manufacturing new blood vessels, and those  that are already present tend to diminish or disappear.                            </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Injections for Diabetic Retinopathy </span> </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Injection&nbsp; Treatment </span></p>
							<p>Various new injections are given in  the eye to reduce the leakage the selling and helps in regressing the new  vessels. These injection s include kenort , macugen, avastin etc. <br />
These are given in the operation  thertere by instilling drops to num your eyes. It is a painsless procedure  lasting 5 mts only some of these drugs might actually improve vision in early  cases.<strong> </strong></p>
							<p><strong>Various injections are given inside the  vitrious cavity of the eye to prevent the formation of VEGF and inflammation  inducing factors </strong> </p>
				<p>These injectons are of two types </p>
							<ul class="bullet">
								<li>Kenacort Injection- This is a steroid injection which reduced the macular edema and       also improves vision in some cases.</li>
								<li>Anti VEGF injection &ndash;eg. Avastin, Macugen, Lucentis. These drugs are  selective against VEGF and prevent formation of new vessels and also  simultaneously reduce the swelling at macula</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Today, not only is the treatment for diabetes so successful, retinopathy can  also be successfully treated using lasers. A cure however depends on catching  the ailment early.And that is the crux of the problem.</p>

							<p><span class="heading2">Laser Surgery</span> </p>
							<p>Laser treatment, once again, is  done in the office as an outpatient procedure. Before treatment, pupils are  dilated and drops are applied to numb the eye. It takes 10 to 15 Mts to do laser  treatment of both the eye and it cause very mild pain and discomfort.</p>
							<p>During the treatment, you may see  flashes of light, After the treatment, you might need someone to drive. You  back; for the rest of the day, your vision will be a little blurry. Laser  treatment is done to treat both diabetic macular edema and proliferative  diabetic retinopathy. Timely laser surgery can reduce vision loss from macular  edema by half, But you might require laser surgery more than once to control  the leaking fluid. Laser light helps in sealing leaking vessels to stabilize  the vision and prevent further visual loss. <br />
							  Similarly, Laser surgery is used to  destroy new and abnormal blood vessels that from at the back of the eye. In  such cases, rather than to focus the laser light on a single spot, hundreds of  small laser spots are placed on the retina. This is called scatter Laser  treatment to save the rest of your sight. Laser surgery may also slightly  reduce your colour and night vision. <br />
							  Tips: Remember laser treatment for  macular edema does not improve the vision; it only stabilizes it.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Vitrous Surgery for vitreous haemorrhage and RD</span> </p>
							<p>Instead of laser Surgery, some  patients may require an eye operation called a Vitrectomy to restore mobile  vision. This procedure is preformed to remove blood from inside the eye.<br />
Early surgery is recommended in  type I diabetics &ndash; insulin dependant diabetes melltius&ndash; IIDDM as these patients  have a greater risk of blindness from complications of proliferative diabetic  retinopathy. Vitrectomy is done under local anaesthesia: this means you will be  awake during the operation. Your surgeon will make a tiny hole in the sclera,  or white of the eye. Next, small sized instruments (about 1mm in diameter) are  placed into the eye in order to achieve surgical goals. </p>
							<p>Tips: Remember if proliferative diabetic retinopathy remains untreated,  about half of those who have it become blind within five years, compared to  just five percent of those who receive treatment. In some cases gas or silicon  oils is left in the eye as a vitreous substitute. </p>
