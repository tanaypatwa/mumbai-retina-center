						  <p>Normally, the eye constantly bathes itself in tears. By  producing tears at a slow and steady rate, the eye stays moist and comfortable.  It is like engine oil which lubricates the engine of a car.</p>
					      <p>Sometimes  people do not produce enough tears or the appropriate quality of tears to keep  their eyes healthy and comfortable. This condition is known as dry eye.</p>

                           <p>The usual symptoms include:</p>
					       <ul class="bullet">
                             <li>Stinging or burning eyes;</li>
					         <li>Scratchiness; irritation; </li>
					         <li>Stringy mucus in or around the eyes;</li>
					         <li>Excessive eye irritation from smoke or wind;</li>
					         <li>Excess tearing; - Reflex </li>
	            </ul>
					       <p><span class="heading2">What is the tear film?</span></p>
					      <p>When you blink, a film of tears spreads over the eye, making  the surface of the eye smooth and clear. Without this tear film, good vision  would not be possible.</p>
					      <p>The tear film consists of three layers:</p>
					      <ul class="bullet">
                            <li>An oily layer;</li>
					        <li>A watery layer;</li>
					        <li>A layer of mucus.</li>
		        </ul>
					      <p>Each layer has its own purpose.</p>
					      <p>The oily layer, produced by the <strong>meibomian glands,</strong> forms the outermost surface of the tear film. Its  main purpose is to smooth the tear surface and reduce evaporation of tears. The  middle watery layer makes up most of what we ordinarily think of as tears. This  layer, produced by the <strong>lacrimal gland,</strong> cleanses the eye and washes away foreign particles or irritants.</p>
					      <p>The inner layer consists of mucus produces by the <strong>conjunctiva. </strong>Mucus allows the watery layer to spread evenly over the surface of the eye and helps the eye remain moist.</p>
					      <p><span class="heading2">Causes dry eye</span></p>
					      <p>Tear production normally decreases as we age. Although dry  eye can occur in both men and women at any age, women are most often affected.  This is especially true after menopause.</p>
					      <p>Dry eye can also be associated with other problems. For example, people with dry eyes, dry mouth, and arthritis are said to have Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome. </p>
					      <p>A wide variety of common medications&mdash;both prescription and  over-the &ndash;counter&mdash;can cause dry eye by reducing tear secretion. </p>
					      People  with dry eye are often more prone to the toxic side effects of eye medications, including artificial tears. For example, the preservatives in certain eyedrops and artificial tear preparations can irritate the eye. These people may need special preservative-free artificial tears.

							<p><span class="heading2">How is dry eye diagnosed?</span></p>
							<p>An ophthalmologist is usually able to diagnose dry eye  by examining the eyes. Sometimes tests that measure tear production are  necessary. One test, called the <strong>Schirmer  tear test,</strong> involves placing filter-paper strips under the lower eyelids to  measure the rate of tear production under various conditions. </p>

							<p><span class="heading2">Treatment</span></p>
							<p>ADDING TEARS substitute</p>
							<p>Eyedrops called artificial tears are similar to your own  tears. They lubricate the eyes and help maintain moisture.</p>
							<p>Preservative-free eyedrops are available for people who are  sensitive to the preservatives in artificial tears. If you need to use  artificial tears more than every two hours, preservative-free brands may be  better for you.</p>
							<p>You  can use the artificial tears as often as necessary-once or twice a day or as  often as several times an hour. People working on computers for long time need  more frequent drops due to the reduction in their blink rate by almost 50%.</p>

						    <a name="medication" id="medication"></a>Medication and Care to be  Taken</span></p>
							<p><span class="heading2">CONSERVING  YOUR TEARS</span></p>
							<p>Conserving your eyes&rsquo; own tears is another approach to  keeping the eyes moist. Tears drain out of the eye through a small channel into  the nose (which is why your nose runs when you cry). Your ophthalmologists may  close these channels either temporarily or permanently. The closure conserves  your own tears and makes artificial tears last longer.</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">OTHER METHODS</span></p>
							<p>A person with dry eye should avoid anything that may cause  dryness, such as an overly warm room, hair dryers, or wind. Smoking is  especially bothersome.</p>
							Some  people with dry eye complain of&nbsp;  &ldquo;scratchy eyes&rdquo; when they wake up. This symptom can be treated by using  an artificial tear ointment or thick eyedrops at bedtime to maintain liberation  and wetness overnight. Use the smallest amount of ointment can cause your  vision to blur.
