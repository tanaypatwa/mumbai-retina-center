<p>Customized LASIK has a higher potential for perfect vision and a lower potential for visual compromise. Patients with more complex prescriptions, unusual corneal shapes or patients who seek the best visual outcome would benefit from Custom LASIK.</p>

<p>Every patient’s eye differs in corneal shape, corneal thickness and pupil size. Wavefront technology analyses the entire visual system from the corneal surface through the crystalline Lens of the eye, and all the way back to the retina. A device called a T Schering Wavefront Analyzer projects a fine grid of 168 light beams onto the retina and captures its image using a high-resolution camera. The image is then compared with one from a normal eye and the information is used to create an ideal vision correction profile, which removes any distortion from the optical path in order to bring an object into perfect focus. Due to the flexibility of numerous possible treatment patterns the laser beam treats each point in a larger surface of the cornea precisely according to unique treatment plan.</p>
<p><b><a name="benefits" id="benefits"></a><span class="heading1">The benefits of Custom LASIK</span></b></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Greater opportunity of achieving 20/20 vision</li>
<li>Reduced opportunity for night vision and glare problems</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="treatment" id="treatment"></a><span class="heading1">Treatment</span></b></p>

<p>Our professional consultants will examine your eyes using equipments as unique as the Wavefront technology itself. To assist them, please do not wear soft Contact Lenses for one week and rigid ones for weeks beforehand, as Lens distort the cornea and might influence the outcome of the treatment.</p>

<p>If you have any old prescriptions for Lenses or Glasses, or details of any eye treatment you have altered over time, we can best determine how to treat them.</p>
<p><b><a name="procedure" id="procedure"></a><span class="heading1">After the procedure</span></b></p>
<p>Before you go home, our staff will give you personalized aftercare instructions and eye drops. After the procedure, you will experience watering of the eyes for a certain time. This is a natural process, but please do not rub your eyes.</p>
<p><b><a name="care" id="care"></a><span class="heading1">FOLLOW UP CARE</span></b></p>
<p>After the surgery, we recommend you see us as advised. This way you can help us properly monitor the success of your treatment.</p>

The eye  pressure, the thickness of the cornea and the size (length) of the eye are  measured, in addition to the ametropia . These examinations are all painless.</p>
      <p>The laser therapy itself involves no stay in hospital; the  patient can return home as soon as the treatment is complete. The preparation  on the day of treatment lasts approximately 40 minutes; after a brief study of  the results of the tests, the patient is given eye drops to ensure that the  subsequent treatment is also painless.</p>
      <p>The laser treatment itself, which only lasts for a few  minutes, is then fairly unspectacular for the patient. As the patient lies back  and relaxes, the ophthalmologist monitors the treatment through a microscope. <br>
        <br>
      When the uppermost layer of the cornea has been removed  (this is a type of topskin, which reforms following the treatment) and the area  intended for laser treatment has been dried, the treatment itself can be  started. </p>
      <p>During the treatment the laser is controlled by complex <strong>computer programs, </strong>which take into  consideration the results of operations on several tens of thousands of  patients. The programs are adapted to the requirements the individual patient  by the ophthalmologist.</p>

      <p>This acronym stands for a treatment method which combines a  microkeratome knife technique with excimer laser therapy.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of therapy, a thin flap of corneal tissue  is created using a microkeratome knife and folded back towards the inner  canthus (see Fig. 1) Then, with the excimer laser, ultra-thin layers of tissue  are removed from the interior of the cornea, with an accuracy measured in a few  thousandths of a millimeter, until the desired correction has been achieved. </p>
      <p>Once the laser therapy is complete the corneal flap is  folded back into its original position and fixed in place.</p>
      <p>The advantages include almost complete freedom form pain  after the operation, stable vision after as little as 2-3 weeks and avoidance  of haze. <br>
        The downside is an increased surgical risk caused by the  microkeratome.</p>

  <a name="questions" id="questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
<p><b>How old do I have to be for Laser vision correction?</b><br>
You need to be over 18 years of age, and you’re Glasses or Contact Lens prescription should not have changed in the last year.</p>

<p><b>How successful is Laser vision correction?</b><br>
Our goal and commitment is to get you to a level of 6/6 (20/20) or better, enough to function without Glasses, to watch TV, play sports and take up occupations where good vision is a must. In fact after treatment, almost 100% of the people can drive without Glasses. At the time of your consultation, our Surgeon will personally discuss with you what can be achieved.</p>
<p><b>Will the procedure hurt?</b><br>
There is no pain during any of the Laser vision procedures since anesthetic eye drops numb your eyes, although some patients may experience mild discomfort or a pressure sensation during their procedure. After LASIK, you may experience mild irritation for a few days, but that’s normal. An over-the-counter pain reliever or use of artificial tears will generally take care of this discomfort.</p> 

<p><b>Will I need to wear shaded Glasses to protect my eyes?</b><br>
It is not necessary to use protective Glasses. However, you should try to minimize chances of any accidental injury to the eye.</p>
<p><b>Can I have both my eyes operated at the same time?</b><br>
This is what we recommend. It has been demonstrated in several large, clinical studies that LASIK’s results and safety are identical whether the procedure is reformed on both eyes simultaneously versus one eye at a time. Most patients prefer to have both eyes operated on the same day, as it is convenient. Also this helps avoid imbalance between the two eyes.</p>

<p><b>How long does the procedure take?</b><br>
In the Laser room your eyes will be thoroughly cleaned and prepared for surgery. The surgery usually takes only 10 minutes. The patient will not have to spend more than 2 hours at our clinic which includes the time taken to perform the surgery.</p>
<p><b>Can I wear coloured Contact Lenses?</b><br>
Yes, you can.</p> 

<p><b>Will I require constant monitoring and check-ups?</b><br>
Initially a couple of follow-up visits to the Doctor are required. After that you come for a check-up, if required.</p>

<p><b>How long will it take for me to see well?</b><br>
Most people achieve good vision the day after surgery and find that their eyes feel fairly normal 24 hours later. However, your sight may improve ever further, and the very best vision can still take one week to ten days.</p>
