						  <p><span class="heading2">What  is macular degeneration?</span></p>
						  <p>Due to the aging of he eye retino also ages leading to  macular degeneration. Macular degeneration is a deterioration or breakdown of  the macula. The macula is a small area in the retina at the back of the eye  that allows you to see fine details clearly and perform activities such as reading  and driving. When the macula does not function correctly, your central vision  can be affected by blurriness, dark areas or distortion. Macular degeneration  affects your ability to see near and far, and can make some activities &ndash; like  threading a needle or reading&mdash;difficult or impossible.</p>
					      <p>Although macular degeneration reduces vision in the central  part of the retina, it usually does not affect the eye&rsquo;s side, or peripheral,  vision. you could see the outline of a face&nbsp;  but not be able to see his nose or eyes. </p>
					      <p>Macular  degeneration alone does not result in total blindness. Even in more advanced  cases, people continue to have some useful vision and are often able to take  care of themselves. Hence these patients need to be reassured constantly as  this is a bilateral condition. </p>

				          <a name="causes" id="causes"></a>Causes and symptoms</span></p>
                           <p>Many older people develop macular degeneration as part of  the body&rsquo;s natural aging process. There are different kinds of macula problems,  but the most common is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Exactly why it  develops is not known, and no treatment has been uniformly effective. Macular  degeneration is the leading cause of severe vision loss over 65. India is seing  an exlosion of these case as our aging population in increasing and cataract  blindness is being eradicated. </p>
                           <p>The two most common types of AMD are &ldquo;dry&rdquo; (atrophic) and  &ldquo;wet&rdquo; (exudative):</p>
                           <p><span class="heading2">&ldquo;DRY&rdquo; MACULAR  DEGENERATION (ATROPHIC)</span></p>
                           <p>Most people have the &ldquo;dry&rdquo; form of AMD. It is caused by  aging and thinning of the tissues of the macula. Vision loss is usually  gradual.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><span class="heading2">&ldquo;WET&rdquo; MACULAR  DEGENERATION (EXUDATIVE)</span></p>
                           <p>The &ldquo;wet&rdquo; form of macular degeneration accounts for about  10% of all AMD cases. It results when abnormal blood vessels form underneath  the retina at the back of the eye. These new blood vessels leak fluid or blood  and blur central vision. Vision loss may be rapid and severe. </p>
                           <p>Deposits  under the retina called drusen are a common feature of dry macular  degeneration. Drusen alone usually do not cause vision loss, but when they  increase in size or number, this generally indicates an increased risk of  developing advanced AMD.</p>
                           <p><span class="heading2">What are the symptoms of macular degeneration</span></p>
                           <p>Macular degeneration can cause different symptoms in  different people. The condition may be hardly noticeable in its early stages.  Sometimes only one eye loses vision while the other eye continues to see well  for many years. But when both eyes are affected, the loss of central vision may  be noticed more quickly.</p>
                           <p>Following are some common ways vision loss is detected:</p>
                           <ul class="bullet">
                             <li>words on a page look blurred:</li>
                             <li>a dark or empty area appears in the center of vision;</li>
                             <li>straight lines look distorted, - Metamorphopsia </li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Amsler  grid with wavy lines                           </p>

							<p><span class="heading2">How is macular degeneration diagnosed?</span></p>
							<p>Many people do not realize that they have a macular problem  until blurred vision becomes obvious. Your ophthalmologist&nbsp; can detect early stages of AMD during a  medical eye examination that includes the following:</p>
							<ul class="bullet">
                              <li>a simple vision test in which you look at a chart that resembles graph paper (Amsler grid);</li>
							  <li>viewing the macula with an ophthalmoscope;</li>
			                  <li>Taking special photographs of the eye called fluorescein angiography to find abnormal blood vessels under the retina.</li>
				</ul>

						    <a name="treated" id="treated"></a>How is it Treated</span></p>
							<p><span class="heading2">How is macular degeneration treated?</span></p>
							<p><span class="heading2">NUTRILTIONAL  SUPPLEMENTS</span></p>
							<p>If the retina is torn and retinal detachment has not  yet occurred, a retinal detachment may be prevented by prompt treatment. Once  the retina becomes detached, it must be repaired surgically by an ophthalmologist.  Successful reattachment of the retina consists of sealing the retinal tear and  preventing the retina from pulling away from the back of the eye again. There  are several surgical procedures that may be used. </p>
							<p>Although the exact causes of macular degeneration are not  fully understood, antioxidant vitamins and zinc may reduce the impact of AMD in  some people.</p>
							<p>A large scientific study found that people at risk for  developing advances stages of AMD lowered their risk by about 25% when treated  with a high-dose combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene and zinc. &ndash;  AREDS study </p>
							<p>It is very important to remember that vitamin supplements  are not a cure for AMD, However, specific amounts of these supplements do play  a key role in helping some people at high risk for advances AMD to maintain  their vision. </p>
							<p><strong>LASER SUGERY, PDT AND  ANTI-VEGF TREATMENTS</strong></p>
							<p>Certain types of &ldquo;wet&rdquo; macular degeneration can be treated  with laser surgery, a brief outpatient procedure that uses a focused beam of  light to slow or stop leaking blood vessels that damage the macula. A treatment  called photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a special drug and  laser treatment to slow or stop leaking blood vessels &ndash; cold laser treatment  with visudyne .</p>
							<p>Another form of treatment targets a specific chemical in  your body that is critical in causing abnormal blood vessels to grow under the  retina. That chemical is called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  Anti-VEGF, reducing the growth of abnormal blood vessels and slowing their  leakage. These drugs are injucted into the votrious cavity and have to be  repeated 4 to 6 weekly in some cases. Lucentis, Avastin, macugen. </p>
							<p>These  procedures may preserve more sight overall, though they are not cures that  restore vision to normal. Despite advanced medical treatment, many people with  macular degeneration still experience some vision loss. AMD is like a train  coming down a hill which we are trying to stop with our various treatment its  progression to inexorable blindness.							</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Low Vision Aids </span></p>
							<p>To help you adapt to lower vision levels, your  ophthalmologist can prescribe optical devices or refer you to a low-vision  specialist or center. Because side vision is usually not affected, a person&rsquo;s  remaining sight is very useful. Often, people can continue with many of their  favorite activities by using low-vision optical devices such as magnifying  devices, closed-circuit television, large-print reading materials and talking  or computerized devices.</p>

							<p><span class="heading2">Testing your vision with the Amsler grid </span></p>
							<p>You can check your vision daily by using an Amsler grid like  the one pictured here. You may find changes in your vision that you wouldn&rsquo;t  notice otherwise. Putting the grid on the front of your refrigerator is a good  way to remember to look at it each day.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Amsler grid</p>
							<p>To use the grid:</p>
							<ul class="bullet">
								<li>Wear your reading glasses and hold this grid 12-15 inches away from your face in good light.</li>
								<li>Cover one eye.</li>
								<li>Look directly at the center dot with the uncovered eye.</li>
								<li>While looking directly at the center dot, not whether all lines of the grid are straight or if any areas are distorted, blurred, blurred or dark.</li>
								<li>Repeat this procedure with the other eye.</li>
								<li>If any area of the grid looks wavy, blurred or dark, contact your ophthalmologist immediately.</li>
