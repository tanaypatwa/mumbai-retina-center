						  <p><strong>It is one of the ocular emergencies causing acute  painless vision loss and hence </strong>Immediate attention is necessary</p>
					      <p>Retinal detachment will affect one out of every 10,000  people each year. It is serious eye problem that may occur at any age, although  usually it occurs in middle aged or older individuals, it is more likely to  develop in people who are nearsighted or in those whose relatives have had  retinal detachments. A hard solid blow to the eye may cause the retina to  detach as well eg cricket ball injury. If not treated early, retina detachment  may lead to implairment or Loss of vision.</p>
					      <p>The  retina is a thin, transparent tissue of light-sensitive active fibers and  cells. It covers the inside wall of the eye like wall-paper. The retina  functions like the film in a camera light passes through the lens of the eye  and is focused on to the retina. The light sensitive retina fibers are  responsible for &ldquo;taking the picture&rdquo;, and transmitting the light image via  optic nerve to the brain. </p>

				          <a name="causes" id="causes"></a>Causes and symptoms</span></p>
                           <p>Most retinal detachments are caused by the presence of one  or more small tears of holes in the retina. Normal aging can sometimes cause  the retina to thin and deteriorate, but more often shrinkage of the vitreous  body, and its separation from the retina &ndash; PVD ( Posterio Vitrious Detachment)  is responsible for deterioration and retinal tears.</p>
                           <p>The vitreous is firmly attached to the retina in a several  places around the back walll of the eye. As the vitreous shrinks, it may pull a  piece of the retina away with it. Leaving a tear or tear or hole in the retina.  Though some shrinkage of the vitreous body occurs naturally with aging and  usually causes no damage to the retina. In most cases, a significant change in  the structure of the vitreous body occurs before the development of a retinal  detachment. Once a retinal tear is present, watery fluid from the vitreous  space may pass through the hole and flow between the retina and the back wall  of the eye. This separates the retina from the back of the eye and causes it  to: detach&rdquo; The part of the retina that is detached will not work properly and  there will be blur or a blind spot in vision hence the patient complaints of  seeing a curtain which is blocking his visual field.</p>
					       <p>It should be noted that there are some retinal detachments  that are caused by other diseases in the eye such as tumors, severe  inflammations, or complications of diabetes. </p>
					       <p>Middle-aged and older persons may see floating black spots  called floaters, and flashes of light in their vision. in most cases, these  symptoms do not indicate serious problems. However, in some eyes the sudden  appearance of spots or flashes of light may indicate substantial shrinkage of  the vitreous with tears in the retina. A Comprehensive dilated fundus  examination by an ophthalmologist is necessary to check the inside of the eye  to determine if retinal tears are present. Such an examination is desirable as  soon as symptoms develop because fresh retinal tears may be treatable without  prolonged surgery before they lead to a more severe retinal detachment.</p>
					       <p>Patients may notice a wavy or watery quality in their  overall vision or the appearance of a dark shadow in some part of their side  vision. Further development of the retinal detachment will blur central vision  and create significant sight loss in one eye unless the detachment is repaired.</p>
					       <p>A  few detachment may occur suddenly and the patient will experience a total loss  of vision in one eye. Similar rapid loss of vision may also be caused by  bleeding into the vitreous area of the eye which may happen when the retina is  torn along a blood vessel &ndash; Vitreous hammerage.					      </p>

							<p><span class="heading2">Detection and Diagnosis</span></p>
							<p>A detached retina cannot be viewed from the outside of  the eye. The ophthalmologist thoroughly examines the retina and the interior  parts of the eye with an instrument called an indirect ophthalmoscope. The  instrument &lsquo;s bright light and magnification allows the ophthalmologist to  locate area of retinal tearing or weakness which need to be corrected during  treatment.</p>

						    <a name="treated" id="treated"></a>How is it Treated</span></p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Treatment</span></p>
							<p>If the retina is torn and retinal detachment has not  yet occurred, a retinal detachment may be prevented by prompt treatment. Once  the retina becomes detached, it must be repaired surgically by an ophthalmologist.  Successful reattachment of the retina consists of sealing the retinal tear and  preventing the retina from pulling away from the back of the eye again. There  are several surgical procedures that may be used. </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Laser Photocoagulation</span></p>
							<p>When new small retinal tears are found with little or  no nearby retinal detachment, the tears are sometimes sealed with a laser  light. The laser places small burns around the edge of the tear. These produce  scars that seal down the edges of the tear and prevent fluid from passing  through and collecting under the retina Ophthalmologic laser surgery is  frequently done as an outpatient treatment and requires no surgical incision.  The laser walls of the tear ans prevents migration of the subretinal fluid. </p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Freezing (Cryopcxy)</span></p>
							<p>Freezing the back wall of the eye behind a retinal  tears also will stimulate scar formation and seal down the edges, Freezing is  often an outpatient procedure but requires local anesthesia to numb the eye.</p>
							<p><span class="heading2">Surgical Repair</span></p>
							<p>Once a significant amount of fluid has collected under the  retina and seprates it from the back of the eye a more complicated operation is  necessary to treat the detachment, such operations vary depending on the extent  of the detachment and resulting damage, but each is designed to press the wall  of the eye against the retinal holes, holding both tissues together until  scarring seals the tears Sometimes fluid must be drained from under the retina  to allow it to settle back onto the eye wall. Once a silicone band or pressure  pad is placed on the outside of the eye to gently push the back wall of the eye  against the retina.</p>
							<p>During such operations, either freezing or a laser, is used  to produce a scare to seal the retinal tear.</p>
							<p>In more complex retinal detachments, it may be necessary to use  a technique called vitrectomy. This operation cuts the connected bands of  vitreous away from the retina and removes the shrunken vitreous body from the  eye. In some cases, when the detached retina itself is severely shrunken and  puckered, it may have to be pushed back to the wall of the eye by temporarily  replacing the vitreous cavity with Silicone oil or gas. </p>
							<p><strong>Over 90% of all  retinal detachments can be reattached by modern surgical techniques.  Occasionally more than one operation may be required. Hence retinal surgey  might have to be done as astage wise procedure initially with scleral buckling  in the first stage followed by vitrectamy with silicon oil. </strong></p>
							<p>If the retina is successfully reattached, the eye will  retain some degree of sight, and blindness will have been prevented. However,  the degree if vision which finally returns about six months after successful  surgery depends upon a number of factors. In general there is less visual  recovery when the retina has been detached for a long duration, or there is a  fibrous growth on the surface of the retina. Approximately 40% of successfully  treated retinal deatachments achieve excellent vision. The remainder attain  varying amount of reading and/or traveling vision </p>
							<p>These  operation may be performed under local anesthesia, it is seldom necessary to  keep patients with retinal detachments immobile for prolonged periods of time  before or after surgery. Patients who require air/gas injection or silicone oil  however, must maintain fixed head positions eg. Prone position with oil&nbsp; as much, as possible for several days after  the operation. Those patients with uncomplicated retinal detachments are  usually allowed to walk to day after surgery and are discharged from the  hospital on same day. Generally, eye drops and ointments are the only  medications required after discharge. Occasionally, glasses or contact lenses  may be prescribed after retinal surgery if vision needs correction. </p>

                                  On the day before operation, your eye will be rechecked by  your surgeon in the Retina Service at the hospital. This is the time for you to  ask him any questions which are in your mind.</p>
                                <p>A doctor from the Anaesthesia Department may call on you  after you are admitted and will prescribe sleeping pills and medication to calm  apprehension.</p>
                                <p>On the day of operation. <strong>Do NOT EAT</strong> unless you are specifically allowed to have a light  breakfast, do not even drink water for 5 hours before the scheduled time of  surgery.</p>
                                <p><strong>Surgery :</strong> If done  under <em>general anesthesia,</em> an  anaesthetic will be injected into a vein of your arm or hand after you arrive  in the operating room. Aside form the prick of the needle you will be  unconscious during the operation,&nbsp; </p>
                                <p>If done under <em>local  anesthesia </em>you will receive two or three pricks of needled in the skin  around your eye. After this no pain will be felt.</p>
                                <p>Depending on the complexity of operation<em>,</em> time required to complete the operation will very form one to six  hours. You probable will sleep until the next morning. And it is usually wise  to discourage visitors until the day after surgery </p>
                                <p>If one of your family is a nurse, she is welcome to attend  on you, but as a rule special nurses are not necessary.</p>
                                <p><strong>After Surgery :</strong> When you wake up, you will find that the eye  which has been operated on is covered with a tight bandage, but the other eye  is uncovered. You may open the eye which has not had surgery and use it. Some  degree of pain is to be expected. When first felt, report it to the nurse who  will administer medicine to relieve it. If nausea develps, other medicines will  help alleviate it. However, if you do vomit after anesthesia (most patients do  not) this will not harm your eye.</p>
                                <p>Unless your surgeon has directed you otherwise, you may turn  on either side on bed and request additional pillows for your comfort. </p>
                                <p><strong>It is very important  to pass urine as soon as possible after operation. </strong>If you are unable to  urinate while lying down, the nurse will assist you to sit or stand to do so.</p>
                                <p>The day after the operation the bandage is removed form the  eye which has been operated on and a light eye pad is applied over it for  another day or two.. When this is removed, sunglasses are worn, either alone or  clipped over your regular glasses.</p>
                                <p>Your eye will be examined daily, and its progress reported  to you. You may read, write, or watch TV but your eyes will tire more quickly  than before the operation. Stop and rest them frequently by closing both eyes.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Operation produces some watering and burning sensation in  the eye. You should not rub it or touch the lid or eye with your fingers. On  the first day after operation, hair may be combed and teeth brushed. Men may  have a shave. Perform all activities slowly and gently without vigorously  shaking the head. Also, it is advisable to get up and walk in order to  encourage circulation of the blood in all parts of the body.</p>
                                <p>Unless your doctor prohibits it, walking along the corridors  is good exercise. The patient&rsquo;s visitors or the nursing staff will assist those  with limited vision.</p>
                                <p>Sitting in a chair is permitted for meals, but otherwise is  to be avoided because with the already sluggish circulation in the legs this  may lead to blood clot formation. Do not dangle your legs over the edges of the  bed. When not walking, lie down on the bed with your legs stretched; the bed  may be cranked up to any angle you wish.</p>
                                <p>On the second or third day after surgery, you may be  permitted shower-bath from the neck down, but do not have a shampoo.</p>
                                <p>Vision in the eye which has had surgery may not return for  days or weeks, and a blur need not be cause for alarm. If your retina is  re-attached, the surgical phase of treatment has been successful and gradual  improvement of vision may be expected to continue for months. Most patients are  discharged form the hospital within seven days after operation.

                                <p>If you live within a convenient  distance of Madras  you may plan to go directly home form the hospital. <br>
                                  Otherwise, it is recommended that  you remain in Madras  for a week after discharge. </p>
                                <p>During the first week out of the  hospital your daily routine will be about the same as it was in the hospital.  Daily cleansing of eyes and application of ointments must be continued. Bending  over and walking up and down stairs are permitted, but proceed cautiously if  you go to a strange place, try to have a companion. Be particularly careful of  pets underfoot. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  When it is necessary to travel by car, enter carefully to prevent striking your head. Avoid sudden starts and stops. If the drive is long, stop every one or two hours and walk for a few minutes to restore leg circuation.

                                  If your eye is healing statisfactoryily, you will be permitted to go home and return to the care of your own eye doctor who will revceive, a detailed report of your entire stay here from our office. You may visit him as and when necessary after your return home. Further changes in your schedule of drops and  medicines will be decided by him. and he will determine when you may return to  work. In general, desk work may be resumed when reading is done in comfort, but  strenuous physical labour must be postponed for at least two months after  surgery.</p>
                                <p>After the  second post-operative week, you may resume a normal life, including marital  relations. <em>Avoid sudden movements and  strenuous or athletic activity for about three months.</em></p>
                                <p>We would  like to <em>examine your aye two &nbsp;months and again six months after your  operation. </em>This is the only sure way of evaluating the result of the  treatment and preventing complications. It you cannot return for these  examinations, please request your doctor to send a complete report of your  condition at the end of six months. </p>
                                <p><strong>The Eye : A Complex Camera</strong></p>
                                <p>The eye may  be compared to a camera in which lenses focus the picture on a sensitive file  (Figure 1). In the human eye, the cornea  (transparent tissue resembling a watch crystal) and the crystalline lens focus  images on the retina, a thin, light- sensitive film at the back of the eye. The  resulting picture is to science. The space between lens and retina is filled  with a transparent jelly the vitreous body. The sclera (white of the eye) is  comparable to the box inside which the camera is built.</p>
                                <p>The iris is the coloured circle in the fornt part of eye,  which acts like the diaphragm of a camera. In its centre is the black pupil  which enlarges or constricts to regulate the intensity of light entering the  eye.</p>
                                <p><strong>What is Detached  Retina?</strong><br>
                                  <br>
                                The choroids is system of blood vessels, located between the  retina and sclera, which provides nourishment to the retina. Which provides  nourishment to the retina. When a portion of the retina becomes separated form  the choroids this detached part looses its nourishment and results in a  temporary decrease in vision. The  vitreous body is a transparent jelly filling the space between the lens and the  retina. It maintains the space of the eyeball, works as a shock absorber, and  helps to hold the retina in place. Shrinkage of&nbsp;  the vitreous body sometimes causes traction on the retina in areas where  the vitreous body is &ldquo; struck&rdquo; to the retina (figure II). This traction may  cause a tear in the retina. Fluid form the vitreous body &nbsp;sometimes causes traction on the retina in  areas where the vitreous body is &rdquo;struck&rdquo;&nbsp;  to the retina (Figure II). This traction may cause a tear in the retina.  Fluid form the vitreous body passes through the retinal tear and detaches the  retina form the retinal tear and detaches the retina form the choroids just as  a wallpaper separates form plaster when water seeps behind it.</p>
                                <p><strong>How is detached retina treated ?</strong><br>
                                  <br>
                                  If the  fluid can be prevented form passing through the hole or tear in the retina and  the already accumulated fluid beneath the retina can be drawn off, the retina  will return to its normal position. There are several ways of accomplishing  this by surgery. but closing the retinal holes is the common aim of all  techniques.</p>
                                <p>Treatment  starts with the careful drawing made of the retina. More than one reinal hole  is often found, and each one must be treated for a successful result.</p>
                                <p>Surgical  techniques very according to the case. Every operation produces an  international scar in the retina and choroid.The scarring process seals of the hole in the retina in  almost the same way as a patch is vulcanized over a leak in an automobile tyre.  In order to hold the scarred area of the choroids against the detached retina  while the bond around the hole is hardening. Plastic material may be attached  to the outside wall of the eye in such a way as to indent it. Creating an  internal hump (Figure III) (Please see page 3). The term &ldquo;buckling&rdquo; which you  may hear used by the doctors, refers to this internal hump. The &ldquo;buckle&rdquo; is the  hump seen by the doctor when he looks into your eye. Ideally, the treated  choroids and retina will lie so that the hole is on the buckle. </p>
                                <p><strong>What causes the hole  in retina ?</strong><br>
                                  <br>
                                As mentioned before, the most frequent cause of&nbsp; a hole in the retina appears to be pulling by  a Shrinking vitreous body. Other types of breaks seem to be  related to changes due to aging which occut in both the retina and vitreous  body. In some cases. retinal holes are the result of&nbsp; a direct blow to the eye which causes the  retina to tear away form its attachment. </p>
                                <p>The mechanism by which retinal holes are produced is not yet  completely understood. It is in this phase of the problem that intensive  investigation appears most likely to be fruitful.</p>
                                <p>Hopefully a better understanding of the mechanisms which  bring about retinal detachment will provide more effective measure for the  prevention and further improvements in the results of treatment. </p></td>
