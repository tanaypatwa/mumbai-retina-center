                    <p>The number of sufferers across the world is now  officially more than 400
                  million and this number is growing exponentially  with the IT era accelerating at 
                  full throttle. All the success is at the cost of the  vision of the IT professionals .
                <p>Having established the seriousness of the problem,  we need to understand
                  the cause. Only then is an effective solution  possible. Since the computer 
                  users are the ones suffering we&rsquo;ll look at their  task of computing.</p>
                <p>Computer work is very strenuous for the eye. There  are two reasons for this-</p>
                <p><strong>1. It involves reading on a  flickering source.</strong></p>
                <p>When we read, we have to  focus on each letter so that our brain can actually 
                  Put together all images and  make sense out of it. To focus on an object 
                  the eye has to adapt to the  brightness of that object <strong>(ADAPTATION) </strong>and  the
                  lens has to adjust ot the  distance, so that the image is clear 
  <strong>(ACCOMMODATION). </strong>Apart form these two processes our eyes also have to
                  Converge so that we get only  one image on the object <strong>(CONERGENCE)</strong>.
                  Since reading involves  constant focusing and refocusing it puts a relatively 
                  high degree of stress on the  eye muscles as compared to normal visual tasks.</p>
                <p>To add to this, computer  monitor is a flickering source, flickering at about 
                  60 &ndash; 75 Hz. This flicker,  although not visible to the naked eye is perceived by
              The brain because the  optical tract can perceive flicker upto 200 Hz. In addition to this most computer work environments are  lit by standard
                tubelights which at flicker at 50 Hz. Thus while  working on the computer we 
                are actually subjected to two different frequencies  and this imbalance can
              cause severe headaches and eyestrain.</p></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><p><strong>2. It involves reading from  sources at different light intensities.</strong></p>
                <p>Any computer user who is  using a reference or source document while
                  working on the computer, has  to constantly shift focus between the document, 
                  the monitor screen, the  keyboard and the surroundings. Each of these has a 
                  different brightness with  the contrast ratio sometimes reaching 1:30. 
                  Therefore each time the user  shifts focus, he has to perform all the three
                  Processes, which are  Adaptation, Accommodation and Convergence.</p>
                <p>The eye requires about 15 &ndash;  20 minutes for dark / light adaptation. E.g.
                  Switching on the lights in a  dark room in the middle of the night, entering a
                  Theatre after the movie has  started, etc.</p>
                <p>However during computer work  the user adjusts to these varying brightness 
                  Within spilt seconds. This  strain is almost equivalent to the strain that we
                  would feel doing 50 push ups  per minute!</p>
                <p>After being abused in this  manner, any other visual pollutant can further 
                  burden the visual system severely.  E.g. an window in the visual field, a 
                  reflection on the monitor  screen, overlite environment, etc.</p>
                <p>Thus the work environment of  the computer user is as critical for his visual
                  health as the task itself.</p>
                <p>Just when we think the eyes  have had enough a brief discussion with some of 
                  these users revealed the  fact that after sitting at their workstations for upto 10
                  hours they go home and watch  television or read for hours. And it doesn&rsquo;t stop
                  there, the lighting for both  these tasks generally, is highly inappropriate. CVS
              is bound to happen. There  are just too many factors at play.</p></td>

                <p><strong>1. Environmental Changes</strong></p>
                <p>This part of the implementation  looks into the lighting environment of the
                  Computer workstation. The  quantity, quality and distribution of light are all
                  adjusted to create a  comfortable, healthy and soothing environment.</p>
                <ul class="bullet">
                  <li>Quantity of light- the quantity of light is task specific. You can&rsquo;t  ask a diamond cutter to work under  a reading lamp. Light is also instrumental in 
                  the way we feel, our mood  etc. An overlite environment can bring on
                  environment can make a  person feel very comfortable even if he is feeling 
                  really tired. We adjust the  light levels to match the task taking into 
                  consideration the person&rsquo;s  age, his visual health etc.</li>
               
                  <li>Quantity of light- the quantity of light is adjusted so that the  lighting is closer to natural sunlight. (either incandescent or 2700K) which is  the most comfortable light for our eyes. E.g. sunlight during sunset and  sunrise </li>
                  <li>Distribution of light &ndash; the quantity of light in the environment is  adjusted so that the light level at his workstation is about 3 times the  ambient light level. Due to this every time a user looks away form his  workplace his eye muscles can relax. This reduces the cumulative stain caused  in the course of the day.</li>

              <td><p><strong>2. Workstation changes</strong></p>
                <p>The arrangement of a  workstation decides the comfort level of the user during the course of the day.  The height of the chair, the position of the monitor etc.</p>
                <p>Peripherals like monitor,  keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. all determine whether
                  or not the user&nbsp; is causing any excessive strain to his joints  or muscles. Wrong 
                  positioning of these items  can cause severe <strong>Repetitive Stress  Injuries </strong>like:
                  Carpal  Tunnel Syndrome, Frozen Shoulder, Tendonitis etc.</p>
                <p>We remove all accelerators  of RSI&rsquo;s by rearrangement of the components of
                  the workstation, thus making  the user much more comfortable in his existing
                  environment. The second  important factor of the workstation is the lighting 
                  level at the workstation. A  user needs light on the workstation depending on 
                  various factors like nature  of work, age, visual health, mood, etc. Hence it is
                  important to provide a  source which is adjustable as per each users needs.</p>
                <p>In addition to this,  computer work demands very specific light distribution. It 
                  requires 400 &ndash; 600 LUX in  the horizontal plane and about 150 &ndash; 200 LUX in
                  vertical plane in front of  the computer monitor. The light should be such that it
                  mitigates the perception of  flicker of the computer monitor, which makes a 
              significant contribution to  the eyestrain felt by the computer users.</p></td>

              <td><p><strong>3. Users Specific Changes</strong></p>
                <p>We audit each users work  habits and work content to prepare a customized 
                  Solution as per the specific  need of each user. E.g. seating posture, posture
                  of hands, posture of neck,  no. of hours of work, etc. In addition we also look
                  into the visual health,  ocular history and most important recreational habits of
                  the computer user. For the  computer user lighting conditions under which he 
                  watches television or reads  at night can seriously affect his visual condition.
                  We look into those habits of  the user as well and give him recommendations
                  accordingly.</p>
                <p>A solution which did not  look into each of these areas would not be complete.
                  If the user had perfect  light distribution but his workstation arrangement was
                  All wrong he would still  suffer. If everything in his environment was perfect but
                  he still went home and  watched television without any ambient light it would 
                  only be a matter of time  before his eyes gave in. Thus this is a problem which 
                  needs to be tackled on a war  footing, taking everything into account.</p>
