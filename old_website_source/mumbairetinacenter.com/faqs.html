		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Simply having a longer eye associated with myopia  probably does not cause retinal detachment, tears, holes, or breaks. A variety  of peripheral retinal degenerations such as lattice degeneration is often  genetically linked to myopia and may cause retinal holes, or tears.</p>

		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> No. Retinal holes, breaks, or tears can occur after  uncomplicated eye surgery performed at the highest level of excellence. This  complication is probably related to normal alterations in the vitreous humor  (jelly) that often occur during or after eye surgery.</p>

		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Direct trauma to the eye can lead to retinal breaks,  holes, or tears that occur days, weeks, months, or even years after the  incident. Trauma severe enough to cause a black eye, hemorrhage on the white  part of the eye, hemorrhage within the eye, a penetration or laceration of the  eye, cataract, light flashes, floaters, or decreased vision can be related to  subsequent retinal detachment.</p>

		  <a name="q5" id="q5"></a><span class="heading2">Q: What injuries typically cause retinal detachments?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Bottle rockets, BB guns, and paint balls lead to  injuries often causing retinal detachment and should be outlawed or controlled.  Bottle, fist, or elbow injuries associated with child abuse, abuse of women, or  fighting can lead to retinal detachment. It is our hope that society will  recognize the epidemic of child and partner abuse and take action. Racquetball,  tennis, golf, soccer, boxing, and diving injuries can lead to retinal  detachment. Patients and their lawyers often ask if falling down, automobile  accidents, or being struck in the head without direct eye injury can lead to  retinal detachment. While this may be possible, the relationship cannot be  proven and is highly improbable.</p>

		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Detachment is more likely to occur if the other eye  has the condition (such as lattice degeneration) associated with retinal  detachment in the first eye. If only one eye suffers a serious injury or  requires eye surgery then, of course, the chance of detachment in the other eye  is not increased by the event.</p>

		  <a name="q12" id="q12"></a><span class="heading2">Q: What treatments are used for retinal detachment repair?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Vitrectomy (removal of the vitreous humor), scleral  buckles, gas bubbles, silicone oil, lasers, cryo (freezing), temporary  balloons, and diathermy (thermal energy created by radio waves) can all be used  to repair retinal detachments. These treatments are often used in combination.  Typical combinations are:</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
          <li>Vitrectomy,       gas, and laser to repair retinal detachments that occur after cataract       surgery and other moderately complex detachments.</li>
		  <li>Gas       followed by laser (pneumatic retinopexy) for less complex retinal       detachments.</li>
		  <li>Scleral       buckling and cryo (freezing) with drainage of the fluid under the retina       for less extensive to moderately difficult retinal detachments.</li>
		  <li>Vitrectomy,  membrane peeling, laser, and silicone oil for difficult retinal detachment and  recurrent detachments.		</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br />
		  <a name="q13" id="q13"></a><span class="heading2">Q: What is a Vitrectomy and why is it used for the  treatment of retinal detachment?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Vitrectomy means to remove the vitreous humor.  Although vitreous humor is often referred to as vitreous jelly, the collagen  fibers in the hyaluronic acid gel (jelly) are the component that cuases retinal  detachment. Vitreous pulls on the retina creating retinal tears or breaks. The  vitreous never regenerates if it is removes, and the eye will have perfect  vision and a normal shape without the vitreous. Patients often are concerned  that the eye will collapse if the vitreous is removed or wonder what is used to  replace it. Aqueous humor fills the former vitreous space within hours after  surgery replacing the artificial aqueous humor (saline with additives called  balanced salt solution) that is used to maintain eye pressure during and  immediately after surgery. Vitreous removal reduces pulling (traction) on the  retina, improves the surgeon&rsquo;s view, and provides space for a gas or silicone  oil bubble.</p>

		  </div>
		<p><br />
		  <a name="q14" id="q14"></a><span class="heading2">Q: Are other techniques used during Vitrectomy procedures?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Yes, scar tissue referred to as epiretinal  membranes can be removed from the retinal surface using various methods of  membrane peeling. Scar tissue can be removed from underneath the retina (sub  retinal surgery). A portion of the retina can be intentionally resected (cut)  if it is contracted too much to become reattached. This is called retinectomy.  Laser or cryo (freezing) treatment is usually used to make an intentional scar  to seal retinal holes, breaks, and tear. This effect takes 7-10 days to be  effective in preventing fluid from flowing through the retinal defect. Most  laser or cryo applications are in the non-seeing far peripheral retina and do  not cause significant loss of peripheral vision.</p>

		<p><br />
		  <a name="q15" id="q15"></a><span class="heading2">Q: What is a Scleral buckle?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Scleral buckles are permanent components usually  made of silicone rubber or silicone sponge material which are sutured to the  outside surface of the back half of the eye in order to create a permanent  indentation. Sometimes the components are shaped like an arc and are placed &frac14;  to &frac34; of the way around the eye. In other situations the buckle is placed all  the way around the eye (encircling buckle). The indentation acts inside of the  eye much as a gasket is used to seal a radiator or the cylinder head of an  automobile engine. In other words, the retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, and  sclera, which are the three layers of tissue under the retina, are pushed  inward against the retina. The buckling effect is placed adjacent to the  retinal breaks, holes and tears to help seal or support them. A secondary  purpose of scleral buckles is to reduce pulling on the retina due to  contraction of the collagen fibers in the vitreous humor. This works by pushing  the retina inward.</p>

		<p><br />
		  <a name="q16" id="q16"></a><span class="heading2">Q: What is the purpose of the gas bubble?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Gas (and silicone oil) bubbles act via their surface  tension to prevent the aqueous humor or saline solution from flowing through  defects in the retina increasing the detachment. In other words, gas or oil is  used to restore the pressure difference that is normally present across the  retina. Either a gas or silicone oil bubble must be used if the viteous is  removed to repair retinal detachment because aqueous humor or saline solution  readily flows through retinal defects. A gas bubble will be replaced by aqueous  humor over a period of one to three weeks or more as the bubble absorbs. Gas  bubbles (and silicone oil) float in the eye fluids and therefore migrate to the  highest part of the eye. If the patient lies on his back, the gas bubble will  come to the front of the eye, and will cause a cataract if the human lens is  present. If the bubble is not on the trouble, it will not be effective in  repairing the retinal detachment. If the patient lies with his right side down,  the bubble will move to the left side of&nbsp;  the treated eye, and vice versa. A patient lies with his right side  down, the bubble will move to the left side of the treated eye, and vice versa.  A patient can be seated with head bowed as if in prayer if the retinal defect  (S) are on the upper part of the retina (or he has a macular hole). He must be  face down in the bed with the head turned slightly left or right if the side or  lower part of the retina is affected by tears, holes, or breaks. This is  similar to the back rub position.</p>
		<p>A patient cannot fly or travel via train, bus, or car to  higher altitudes if there is a bubble in the eye unless the bubble is very,  very small. If this rule is broken, the bubble will expand, causing severe pain  and potentially permanent loss of vision.</p>
		<p>Patients  often ask, &ldquo;Can I drive with a gas bubble in my eye?&rdquo; If the other eye is  perfect, it is legal to drive. Glare and obstructed vision from the bubble may  make driving more difficult for certain individuals. Most of the prescribed  positions after surgery are not compatible with driving. If a patient has a  perfect non-operated eye and must drive in an emergency situation it is  probably permissible for a short period of time. </p>

		  <a name="q17" id="q17"></a><span class="heading2">Q: Are gas bubbles ever used without Vitrectomy?</span></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Sometimes gas bubbles are injected in the office to  repair the retinal detachment without going to the operating room. This  technique is called pneumatic retinopexy and is used for less complicated  retinal detachments. This technique is usually used for detachments on the  upper part of the eye because bubbles float to the top. The eye is anesthetized  with drops or an injection and sterilized with a special disinfectant. A small  bubble is injected and then fluid is removed from the front of the eye to  equalize the pressure in the eye. Often the vision dim out for a few seconds  until this fluid removal step is completed, normalizing the eye pressure.  Sometimes cryo (freezing) is used before the gas bubble is injected but more  often laser is applied to the retinal hole, break, or tear after the gas bubble  reattaches the retina.</p>

		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> There can be: there is a significant incidence of  cataract progression after vitreous surgery. Some doctors believe that patients  with an absolutely clear tens develop cataracts as a result of vitreous surgery  for retinal detachment already have nuclear sclerotic cataracts (yellowing of  the center of the lens), which often worsen after vitreous surgery. Surgeons  differ widely on the percentage of patients that suffer cataract progression  due to vitreous surgery. Our doctors believe that the progression rate is about  10%: others believe that it is 100%.</p>
		<p>Retinal detachment can occur after vitreous surgery  performed for any reason, including repair of retinal detachment. Sometimes  this is due to the method used but more often it is due to increasing traction  on the retina from further contraction of the vitreous.</p>
		<p>Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the most common  cause of failure of retinal detachment surgery and often requires Vitrectomy  and silicone oil, Epimacular membranes (EMM) occur after about 2.5% of otherwise  successful retinal detachment procedures.</p>
		<p>Pressure elevation (glaucoma) can occur after all forms of  eye surgery including surgery for retinal detachment.</p>
		<p>Infection  is very rare after retinal detachment surgery (about 0.02%)	  </p>

		<p><span class="heading2">A:</span> Precautions regarding gas bubbles and silicone oil are  noted above.</p>
		<p>In general, the retina becomes adherent to the underlying  tissue, &ldquo;sealing&rdquo; the retinal holes/breaks/tears in 7-10 days. Normal activity  can be resumed after the retina has been completely attached for two-three  weeks. Older practices prohibited many activities such a bending over, lifting,  etc.: avoiding these activities is no longer necessary. An eye patch is no  longer needed after the first post-operative day.</p>
		<p>Antibiotic drops are usually used for five to seven days,  dilating drops for one to three weeks, and steroid drops for two or three  weeks. Steroid drops are not used if it is thought the patient is genetically  susceptible to steroid glaucoma. If the patient notices any new shadow or  blockage of vision after the gas bubble is gone, it should be reported to the  doctor.</p>
		<p>Reattaching retinas often produce light flashes and floaters  similar to those noted when detachment began.</p>
		<p>Vitrectomy,  laser, gas bubbles and silicone oil produce little if any pain. Antibiotics  injected at the end of surgery are usually responsible for post-operative pain.  Increased pressure can result from gas bubbles and occasionally silicone oil  and other surgical techniques. Pain should be reported to the doctor. Scleral  buckling surgery can produce moderate pain but most pain is from the  antibiotics.</p>
