Common symptoms include fuzzy vision, glare, poor night vision, and fading colors. While most common with aging, it can also be caused by diabetes, injury, or medications.

                            <p>Choosing the right Intraocular Lens (IOL) is key for cataract surgery. The best choice depends on your lifestyle and vision needs.</p>

                                <li><strong>Monofocal IOLs:</strong> Offer clear vision at a single distance (near, intermediate, or far). Best for patients comfortable with glasses for other distances.</li>
                                <li><strong>Multifocal IOLs:</strong> Provide clear vision at multiple distances, reducing the need for glasses. May cause halos or glare at night.</li>
                                <li><strong>Toric IOLs:</strong> Correct astigmatism, providing clearer vision for those with an irregular corneal surface.</li>
                                <li><strong>EDOF IOLs:</strong> Offer a balanced range of vision with fewer side effects than multifocal lenses, ideal for active lifestyles.</li>

                            <p>Glaucoma is a serious condition that damages the optic nerve, often due to increased pressure in the eye. It is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection and treatment can prevent vision loss. Since it often has no early symptoms, regular eye exams, especially after age 40, are critical. Treatment involves managing eye pressure through medication, laser, or surgery.</p>

                            <p>Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea, the eye's middle layer. It can cause significant damage and vision loss if left untreated. Symptoms include eye redness, pain, light sensitivity, and blurred vision. Uveitis can be linked to infections, injuries, or systemic diseases, but often the cause is unknown. A "red eye" should never be ignored and requires prompt evaluation by an ophthalmologist.</p>
